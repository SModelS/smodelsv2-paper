#SModelS hover information; options are:
#
#SmodelS_status -> prints whether the point is excluded or not by SModelS
#r_max -> shows the highest r-value for each parameter point
#chi2 -> shows the chi^2 value which corresponds to r_max, if available (if not, the output is 'none')
#Tx -> shows the topology/ies which give r_max
#Analysis -> shows the experimental analysis from which the strongest constraint (r_max) comes from
#MT_max -> shows the missing topology with the largest cross section (in SModelS bracket notation)
#MT_max_xsec -> shows the cross section of MT_max
#MT_total_xsec -> shows the total missing cross section (i.e. the sum of all missing topologies cross sections)  
#MT_long_xsec -> shows the total missing cross section in long cascade decays  
#MT_asym_xsec -> shows the total missing cross section in decays with asymmetric branches 
#MT_outgrid_xsec -> shows the total missing cross section outside the mass grids of the experimental results
#file -> shows the name of the input spectrum file
