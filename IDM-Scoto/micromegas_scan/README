- idm_randscan.c : random scan program for IDM (with decays into pions) in micromegas 5.2.7a
  various ways of scanning over mH0, mHc-mH0, mA, lam2; lam2=0.01 (fixed)
  uses Rand.c for Uniform (flat) and Normal (Gaussian) distributions of random variables
  constraints: all lambdas < 4pi; 
               chi2(S,T)<5.99, corresponding to 95% CL for two d.o.f.
               Omega < Omega_Planck + 10% theory uncertainty  
               rescaled pval from DM direct detection experiments < 0.1 (90% CL)

- for interfact to SModelS v2.0.0 replace 
    micromegas_5.2.7.a/include/SMODELS.inc 
    micromegas_5.2.7.a/Packages/SMODELS.makef
    micromegas_5.2.7.a/sources/smodels.c
